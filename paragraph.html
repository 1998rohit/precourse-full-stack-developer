<p>Should u send sample questions for java because i don't know how they ask questions in assignment 2 so if u send sample questions its helpful for write exam please reply</p>

<p>here they teach how to learn coding from scratch. handling a laptop does not need an it background. its just basics. just go through some videos on youtube on which you are facing a problem in your laptop. that might help. and if you cant handle a laptop it might be very very difficult for you to learn to code and practice it. </p>
